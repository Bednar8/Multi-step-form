# Frontend Mentor - Multi-step form solution

This is a solution to the [Multi-step form challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/multistep-form-YVAnSdqQBJ).

## Overview

### The challenge

In this challenge, users progress through various steps of a form, entering simple data and selecting a plan. Users have the option to choose between a monthly or yearly subscription plan. Following this, they customize their plan by selecting additional features that enhance their gaming experience. Towards the end, users review all their choices in a summary step. Here, they can either confirm or modify their subscription plan. Throughout the process, users have the flexibility to navigate back to previous steps for updating their selections.
